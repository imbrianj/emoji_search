emoji_search
============

Visit the page here: http://imbrianj.github.io/emoji_search/

Quickly search emoji based on tags from mobile or desktop.  Self-contained, so run it locally if you want.

Designed to work with a static page (no XHR, no external files) for any platform that supports Emoji.  Sorry, Chrome.

Load the page and either browse or begin searching in real-time via the search bar.

Click on any emoji to change the URL to a shareable link and bring up a dialog to easily copy it to your clipboard.

If you have suggestions on tag additions or changes, feel free to submit a pull request.
